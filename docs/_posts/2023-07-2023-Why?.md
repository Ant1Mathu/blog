# Background
I’m a 27-year-old French software engineer, living in Nice, France. Grew up in the most rural place. 100$ self (not-yet) made.

# Motivations
I realized there was no future for me in France.
- Identity: native french will be in minority in 2 generations.
- Insecurity: not only illegal immigrants commit crimes, but also “French” maghrebians/africans. And no one cares.
- Taxes: France ranks nb 1 in the world from 30 to 45% on income taxes.
- 4% anual rate loans.
- Majority of the people are leftist golems, matrixed by the media.

Today, after realizing I could not buy an appartment, I scrolled twitter few seconds and saw : 
- Rome, where I wanted to escape, being on a good path to become as putrified as Paris.
- Someone killed with a machete in Rennes. I wasn't even chocked, that's business as usual.
- Cherry on the cake: Thomas Pesquet, french astonaut celebrity, writing a cheap feminist tweet.

After years of being emotionnaly invested in Politics Ideas, I think I am in the right tail of the gaussian curve regarding those topics.
I'll write down some facts here so I can free up some brain RAM and move on.
